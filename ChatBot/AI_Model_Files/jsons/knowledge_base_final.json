conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3", "Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated over a period of months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.A very high dose is often needed early in treatment, but, if too high a dose is used persistently, people can develop symptoms of hypothyroidism", "This titrating of the dose is difficult to do accurately, and so sometimes a \"block and replace\" attitude is taken", "In block and replace treatments thyrostatics are taken in sufficient quantities to completely block thyroid hormones, and the person treated as though they have complete hypothyroidism.", "", "Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations, trembling, and anxiety are mediated by increases in beta-adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces", "Beta blockers, typically used to treat high blood pressure, are a class of drugs that offset this effect, reducing rapid pulse associated with the sensation of palpitations, and decreasing tremor and anxiety", "Thus, a person with hyperthyroidism can often obtain immediate temporary relief until the hyperthyroidism can be characterized with the Radioiodine test noted above and more permanent treatment take place", "Note that these drugs do not treat hyperthyroidism or any of its long-term effects if left untreated, but, rather, they treat or reduce only symptoms of the condition.Some minimal effect on thyroid hormone production however also comes with propranolol-which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, determined by the different isomers of propranolol", "L-propranolol causes beta-blockade, thus treating the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance", "D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, providing some though minimal therapeutic effect", "Other beta-blockers are used to treat only the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism", "Propranolol in the UK, and metoprolol in the US,

for surgical intervention", "This includes those that cannot tolerate medicines for one reason or another, people that are allergic to iodine, or people that refuse radioiodine.A 2019 systematic

iodine-131), which has a biological half-life from 8-13 hours", "Iodine-131, which also emits beta particles that are far more damaging to tissues at short range, has a half-life of approximately 8 days", " People not responding sufficiently to the first dose are sometimes given an additional radioiodine treatment, at a larger dose", "Iodine-131 in this treatment is picked up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, rendering the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive.Since iodine is picked up more readily (though not exclusively) by thyroid cells, and (more important) is picked up even more readily by over-active thyroid cells, the destruction is local, and there are no widespread side effects with this therapy", "Radioiodine ablation has been used for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breastfeeding (breast tissue also picks up and concentrates iodine)", "Once the thyroid function is reduced, replacement hormone therapy (levothyroxine) taken orally each day replaces the thyroid hormone that is normally produced by the body.There is extensive experience, over many years, of the use of radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid overactivity and this experience does not indicate any increased risk of thyroid cancer following treatment", "However, a study from 2007 has reported an increased number of cancer cases after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.The principal advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it tends to have a much higher success rate than medications", "Depending on the dose of radioiodine chosen, and the disease under treatment (Graves' vs", "toxic goiter, vs", "hot nodule etc.), the success rate in achieving definitive resolution of the hyperthyroidism may vary from 75 to 100%", "A major expected side-effect of radioiodine in people with Graves' disease is the development of lifelong hypothyroidism, requiring daily treatment with thyroid hormone", "On occasion, some people may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease present, the size of the thyroid, and the initial dose administered.People with Graves' disease manifesting moderate or severe Graves' ophthalmopathy are cautioned against radioactive iodine-131 treatment, since it has been shown to exacerbate existing thyroid eye disease", "People with mild or no ophthalmic symptoms can mitigate their risk with a concurrent six-week course of prednisone", "The mechanisms proposed for this side effect involve a TSH receptor common to both thyrocytes and retro-orbital tissue.As radioactive iodine treatment results in the destruction of thyroid tissue, there is often a transient period of several days to weeks when the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen following radioactive iodine therapy", "In general, this happens as a result of thyroid hormones being released into the blood following the radioactive iodine-mediated destruction of thyroid cells that contain thyroid hormone", "In some people, treatment with medications such as beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol, etc.) may be useful during this period of time", "Most people do not experience any difficulty after the radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill", "On occasion, neck tenderness or a sore throat may become apparent after a few days, if moderate inflammation in the thyroid develops and produces discomfort in the neck or throat area", "This is usually transient, and not associated with a fever, etc.It is recommended that breastfeeding be stopped at least six weeks before radioactive iodine treatment and that it not be resumed, although it can be done in future pregnancies", "It also shouldn't be done during pregnancy, and pregnancy should be put off until at least 6-12 months after treatment.A common outcome following radioiodine is a swing from hyperthyroidism to the easily treatable hypothyroidism, which occurs in 78% of those treated for Graves' thyrotoxicosis and in 40% of those with toxic multinodular goiter or solitary toxic adenoma", "Use of higher doses of radioiodine reduces the number of cases of treatment failure, with penalty for higher response to treatment consisting mostly of higher rates of eventual hypothyroidism which requires hormone treatment for life.There is increased sensitivity to radioiodine therapy in thyroids appearing on ultrasound scans as more uniform (hypoechogenic), due to densely packed large cells, with 81% later becoming hypothyroid, compared to just 37% in those with more normal scan appearances (normoechogenic).", "", "Thyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism", " It is treated aggressively with resuscitation measures along with a combination of
